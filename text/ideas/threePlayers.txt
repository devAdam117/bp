“Three players enter a room and a red or blue hat is placed on each person’s head.
The color of each hat is determined by [an independent] coin toss. No communication
of any sort is allowed, except for an initial strategy session before the game begins.
Once they have had a chance to look at the other hats [but not their own], the
players must simultaneously guess the color of their own hats or pass. The puzzle
is to find a group strategy that maximizes the probability that at least one person
guesses correctly and no-one guesses incorrectly.”
The naive strategy would be for the group to agree that one person should guess and the
others pass. This would have probability 1/2 of success. Find a strategy with a greater chance
for success. (The solution is given in the article.)
For a different problem, allow every one of n people to place an even bet on the color of his
hat. The bet can either be on red or on blue and the amount of each bet is arbitrary. The group
wins if their combined wins are strictly greater than their losses. Find, with proof, a strategy
with maximal winning probability.
