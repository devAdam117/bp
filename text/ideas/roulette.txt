 We are playing Russian roulette, with a standard 6-chamber revolver. I put two bullets in adjacent chambers, spin, point the gun at my head, and pull the trigger. 
 Click. 
 I'm still alive. 
 It's now your turn, and I hand the gun to you, and give you two choices.

Would you rather, assuming you want to live,

a) Re-spin, aim at your own head and pull the trigger.
b)  Do not spin, aim at your own head, and pull the trigger.

Why?
